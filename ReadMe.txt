Welcome!
This program is supposed to read values from a textfile regarding date, time, location, temperature and humidity.
A sensor for temperature and humidity is used in an indoor apartement environment and an outdoor balconyenvironment during the same period of time.

To pass the assignment:
The program should contain algorithms for 
-searching for a specifik date 
-calculating the date for meteorological winter 
-calculating the date for meteorological fall
-display average temperatures per day
-display average humidity per day
-calculating risk of molt using moltindex
-sorting the above information

To get a higher grade:
-calculate when the balconydoor is open
-print a list that is sorted based on the largest difference between the indoortemperature and the outdoortemperature.


So what has been done:
All of the basic tasks has been done, the program displays everything I want it to except for the higher grade- tasks.

What can/should/need to be improved:
-Calculate when the balconydoor is open.
-Print a list that is sorted based on the largest difference between the indoortemperature and the outdoortemperature.
-Improve the calculations on moltindex to expand it to a 6-index scale witch seems to be mostly used in a professional context.
-Try to break out more of the code in "Main".cpp to functions like winter, fall, search and calculations that occurs before insertion to the vectors.
-Still considering using 1 vector instead of 2 but am still hesitating a bit due to potential risks. Alternatly using two different structs. 
-Integrate exceptionhandling. Minimum has been used since it was not a requirement for the assignment.
-Make a more "user-friendly" interface. Try to be a bit creative.

To help myself to achieve further knowledge: 
-I will take a repetition-class in math.
-Set a specifik schedule for programming that is not connected to a specifik course. 
-Book a meeting with my coding-mentors every other week to get a chance to ask the "stupid questions".
-Set a limit for myself on how long I get to be stuck on something.
